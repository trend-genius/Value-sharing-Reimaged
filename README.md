# Value-sharing-Reimaged  
*A modular analytics suite for social-media data*

---

## Overview  
**Value-sharing-Reimaged** re-imagines how value is extracted and shared from social-media content.  
The project is split into four independent modules:

- **Status Analysis** – problem diagnostics & issue tracking  
- **Commentary Sentiment** – fine-grained sentiment on user comments  
- **Comment Interaction Analysis** – engagement-volume analytics  
- **Video Data Judgment** – performance metrics from view counts & related metadata  

All Python dependencies are centralized in `requirements.txt`; every module is self-contained and can be run in isolation.

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/Value-sharing-Reimaged.git
   cd Value-sharing-Reimaged
   ```

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Quick Start

1. **Pick a module**  
   Each module is independent; you can run any subset without touching the others.

2. **Enter the folder**
   ```bash
   cd "Status Analysis"            # or any other module
   ```

3. **Follow the README**  
   Open the local `README.md` inside the module for exact run commands, sample data locations, and configuration options.

## Notes & Best Practices

- All configuration files, sample datasets, and expected outputs live **inside** each module.  
- Do **not** edit `requirements.txt` unless you are adding a global dependency.  
- For module-specific parameters, edit the config file provided in that folder.  
- If something breaks, first check the module’s `README.md`; open an issue only if the answer is missing.
